            There are four milestones for this project.

            The following elaboration provides you with certain specifications to meet, but also leaves certain project parameters for you to decide on. There are no absolute “correct answers” for these parameters. You are expected to explore the dataset and decide on parameters that provide meaningful insights into the data.

            ### (1) Exploratory data analysis

            Build the first version of your app that allows users to visualize and explore the data to derive insights. Use Streamlit’s multipage app feature to offer 2 visualization functioonalities:

            #### (1.1) Trend over time

            Show the trend of <x> over the years 2020-2022, where <x> is selectable by users.

            - Provide users with at least 2 options for <x>, which are features of your choice taken from the dataset. They should offer meaningful insights into the data. (You may check out the Code section in the Kaggle dataset sources for inspiration.)
            - You may define a sensible scope (e.g., by country, gender, age, ...) relevant to <x> for the visualization. In other words, it is not a must to capture all survey participants for every visualization. This scope (if any) must be made explicitly clear in the visualization.

            ####  (1.2) Statistical tendencies

            Show [statistics] of <y> in <period>, where <y> and <period> are selectable by users.

            - Provide users with at least 2 options for <y>, which are features that you select from the dataset. These may or may not be the same features as <x> in (1.1).
            - Users shall be able to set <period> to:
                * Any single year (e.g., 2020);
                * Any two consecutive years (e.g., 2020-2021);
                * All three years within the dataset.
            - You may decide on the statistical measure and the scope (see point (1.1)) that will offer meaningful insight. 
                
            You will be asked to discuss the insights from these visualizations in your final report and presentation (Milestones 3 and 4). You will also give a live demo of the app in class by this milestone.

            ### (2) Recommendation system

            Add a recommendation functionality to your app.

            - Allow app users to input their personal / professional profiles, and show recommended job roles based on the similarity of their profiles with those in the dataset.
            - Your team shall determine what features to collect via user input, to perform the recommendation with reasonable accuracy.

            You should well document your recommendation methodology for inclusion in your final report and presentation (Milestones 3 and 4). You will also give a live demo of the app in class by this milestone.

            ### (3) Presentation (recording)

            Prepare a video recording of your project presentation. Your team may choose one or more team members to present.

            The presentation is essentially an articulation of your final report and should cover:

            - Dataset and preprocessing
            - Exploratory analysis insights (Milestone 1)
            - Approach for the job role recommendation task (Milestone 2)
            - Reflection and conclusion

            Visualizations from the app could be used to support the points you discuss in the presentation. However, the presentation should not be about your app development process nor a demo of your app functionalities. Separate opportunities will be arranged for the app demo. The video duration should not exceed 10 minutes.

            ### (4) Final report

            The report should be a single PDF document not exceeding 8 pages. The report should present your data analysis methodology and not the app development. Follow this outline:

            - 1 cover page with project title and listing of team members (name and student ID)
            - 1 page describing the dataset and preprocessing
            - 2 pages describing exploratory analysis insights from Milestone 1
            - 2 pages describing your approach for the recommendation task from Milestone 2
            - 1 page of reflection and conclusion
            - 1 page of references

            Do not include screenshots of the code base in the report. If you need to include app screenshots, do so sparingly.
